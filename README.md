# sha256brute


sha256brute.py is a CPU powered SHA256 multicore alphabetic password bruteforcer<br>
This means that it will check every possible password in SHA256 until it finds a match.<br>
To speed things up I added multiple modes to the bruteforcing tool:<br>
Mode 1: numeric mode<br>
  Aliases: 1, number<br>
  Description: will go through every possible numeric password<br>
Mode 2: letter mode <br>
  Aliases: 2, letter<br>
  Description: will go through the alphabet in uppercase and lowercase<br>
Mode 3: lower mode <br>
  Aliases: 3, lower<br>
  Description: will go through the alphabet in lowercase<br>
Mode 4: upper mode <br>
  Aliases: 4, upper<br>
  Description: will go through the alphabet in uppercase<br>
Mode 5: all mode <br>
  Aliases: 5, all<br>
  Description: will go through all characters (the alphabet in lower and uppercase and all numbers) also the slowest variant
